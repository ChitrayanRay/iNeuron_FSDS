    "- While Excel (XLS and XLSX) file formats are better for storing more complex data, CSV files are supported by nearly all data upload interfaces. If you are planning to move your data between platforms, export and import it from one interface to another, you might be better off with the CSV file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSV:** CSV refers to Comma-Separated Values. It holds plain text as a series of values (cells) separated by commas (, ) in a series of lines (rows). CSV file can actually open in a text editor and read it. There are lots of applications for reading CSV files, and many languages provide built-in functions that simplify reading/writing CSV format. These files are majority used by professionals in data analysis or visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Excel:** Microsoft Excel is used to displays the data in horizontal and vertical rows. The data are usually stored in the cells. We have an option of formulas in Excel that can be used for data and its place of storage. You can even add any charts, graphics, etc. to make it more presentable."
